# Jaco Robotic Arm
Jaco Kinova arm is a 6DOF robot arm that can perform a wide range of tasks. In this project we use the model j2n6s200 Jaco arm.
We implemented this project during our internship at Athena RC.
## Gazebo Simulator
This repository contains files for simulating the robot arm in gazebo simulator using Ros.
## Unity (game engine)
There are also files for simulating the robot arm in Unity and perform a simple pick and place pipeline.
## Object detection
We also implemented two python scripts for garbage detection and leaf disease detection.
